# Description üìù

This repo is for easy installation of linux tools.
Most of them are just my personal tools and apps but the scripts can be edited to suit personal needs.

I prefer using package manager when possible because at times the current version isn't always available for the distro you are trying to install on

---

The repository is split into different branches.
[Arch Scripts](https://github.com/rileyhawk1417/linux_quickSetup/tree/arch_scripts), this branch is mainly for Arch Based Distros.
[Ubuntu Scripts](https://github.com/rileyhawk1417/linux_quickSetup/tree/ubuntu_scripts), this branch is for Ubuntu Based Distros.
[Rice Setups](https://github.com/rileyhawk1417/linux_quickSetup/tree/rice_script), this branch is for customization. Just so you know some things will work on arch and others wont.
