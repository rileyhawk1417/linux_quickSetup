# Description üìù

This repo is mainly for customization(Arch Based). 
Most of them are just my personal tools and apps but the scripts can be edited to suit personal needs.

I prefer using package manager when possible because at times the current version isn't always available for the distro you are trying to install on

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
Some scripts are specific to a distro and wont work everywhere.
Am not an expert am also learning, feel free to give some pointers.

## ToDo List
- [ ] Plans to support other systems like Arch 
- [ ] Optimize script and remove bugs 
- [x] Allow power users to use cli without using interactive shell?
- [x] Add peazip file compressor to general tools, or alternatives like unrar.
- [ ] Refactor to make it robust or efficient.
## Link üåç
When learning bash or shellscript, I recommend the following links. They are not fuly detailed but at least cheatsheets can give a rough idea of what to do
