# Description üìù

This repo is for easy installation of linux tools and libraries.
Most of them are just my personal tools and apps but the scripts can be edited to suit personal needs.

I prefer using package manager when possible because at times the current version isn't always available for the distro you are trying to install on

---
## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
The scripts can run on Arch based systems or systems that can use pacman or pamac.
Am not an expert am also learning, feel free to give some pointers.

## ToDo List
- [x] Plans to support other systems like Arch
- [ ] Optimize script and remove bugs
- [x] Allow power users to use cli without using interactive shell?
- [x] Add peazip file compressor to general tools, or alternatives like unrar.
- [ ] Refactor to make it robust or efficient.


## Using the hotspot tool

```shell
sudo create_ap Markus WatchDogs
```
