# Description üìù

This repo is for easy installation of linux tools.
Most of them are just my personal tools and apps but the scripts can be edited to suit personal needs.

Added a function where it will copy my existing profiles, that are in the folders to the new setup. Also edited the README file.

## 11/08/21
---
Refactored some code and added some more new functions, calling too many functions in one command didnt work.
So some of the functions were split into new files instead and then imported.
