## Description

- The scripts are going to be automated as much as possible.
- Had decided to try Manjaro so am documenting everything I install, in case I bake the system. Theres a setup script on standby.


## Known Issues

- Depending on which arch distro you if it prioritizes 32 bit first instead of 64 bit.
- Most likely Homebrew wont run. Homebrew has dropped support for 32 bit.
