## Description

The scripts are going to be automated as much as possible.
Had decided to try Manjaro so am documenting everything I install.
In case I brick the system. Theres a setup script on standby.

Well I learnt after using Manjaro for a while then hopping over to a few other distros. That Arch linux is pretty much the same even if its a derivative.
As long as the engine is the same.
So this part of the branch will just install arch scripts. 
Also there's a custom WM called Hyprland thats nice so the scripts are setup for it.

## Known Issues

- Depending on which arch distro you if it prioritizes 32 bit first instead of 64 bit.
- Most likely Homebrew wont run. Homebrew has dropped support for 32 bit.
